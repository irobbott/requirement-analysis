# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## üìñ Introduction
This repository is dedicated to exploring the concept of **Requirement Analysis** in software development.  

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. The goal is to clearly define what the system should do before actual development begins.  

Through this repository, we will document the key processes, techniques, and deliverables involved in requirement analysis.

## ‚ùì What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.  
It ensures that developers, designers, and business stakeholders have a clear and shared understanding of what the system should do before development begins.

### üîë Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- **Foundation for Development:** Provides a solid blueprint that guides design, coding, and testing.  
- **Minimizes Errors:** Detecting unclear or missing requirements early helps avoid costly mistakes later in the project.  
- **Aligns Stakeholders:** Ensures that all parties (clients, users, developers, testers) agree on the system‚Äôs goals and functionality.  
- **Improves Quality:** Well-defined requirements lead to software that meets user needs and business objectives.  
- **Saves Time and Cost:** Reduces rework and scope creep by clarifying expectations at the start.  

In short, Requirement Analysis acts as the **bridge between stakeholders and developers**, ensuring that the final product is functional, user-friendly, and aligned with business goals.
