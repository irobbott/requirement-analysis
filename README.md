# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 📖 Introduction
This repository is dedicated to exploring the concept of **Requirement Analysis** in software development.  

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. The goal is to clearly define what the system should do before actual development begins.  

Through this repository, we will document the key processes, techniques, and deliverables involved in requirement analysis.

## ❓ What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.  
It ensures that developers, designers, and business stakeholders have a clear and shared understanding of what the system should do before development begins.

### 🔑 Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- **Foundation for Development:** Provides a solid blueprint that guides design, coding, and testing.  
- **Minimizes Errors:** Detecting unclear or missing requirements early helps avoid costly mistakes later in the project.  
- **Aligns Stakeholders:** Ensures that all parties (clients, users, developers, testers) agree on the system’s goals and functionality.  
- **Improves Quality:** Well-defined requirements lead to software that meets user needs and business objectives.  
- **Saves Time and Cost:** Reduces rework and scope creep by clarifying expectations at the start.  

In short, Requirement Analysis acts as the **bridge between stakeholders and developers**, ensuring that the final product is functional, user-friendly, and aligned with business goals.

## 🌟 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is one of the most critical stages in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  
It determines the success of the entire project by ensuring that the software meets the actual needs of users and stakeholders.  

### ✅ Key Reasons

1. **Clear Understanding of Needs**  
   - Helps developers and stakeholders agree on the exact goals of the project.  
   - Reduces confusion and miscommunication by defining requirements clearly.  

2. **Prevents Costly Errors and Rework**  
   - Mistakes discovered later in the SDLC (during coding or testing) are expensive to fix.  
   - Early identification of requirements minimizes rework and project delays.  

3. **Improves Software Quality**  
   - Well-documented requirements ensure that the final product is user-focused, functional, and reliable.  
   - Provides measurable criteria to test whether the system meets user expectations.  

4. **Supports Better Project Management** *(optional bonus)*  
   - Acts as a roadmap for planning, budgeting, and resource allocation.  
   - Makes it easier to track progress and manage scope changes effectively.

## 🛠️ Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several key activities that ensure the requirements are properly identified, documented, and validated.  

### 🔑 Activities

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting information from stakeholders, users, and documents to understand the needs and expectations for the system.  

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Using techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, and brainstorming sessions to uncover both stated and hidden requirements.  

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Recording requirements in a structured format (e.g., Software Requirement Specification – SRS) to serve as a reference for developers, testers, and stakeholders.  

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Evaluating and organizing requirements to identify conflicts, overlaps, or gaps. Creating models such as use case diagrams, data flow diagrams, or prototypes to represent requirements visually.  

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy, completeness, feasibility, and alignment with business objectives before moving to the design phase.

  ## 📂 Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are generally divided into two main categories: **Functional** and **Non-functional** requirements.  

### ⚙️ Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define **what the system should do** — the specific features, behaviors, and functions of the application.  

**Examples for the Booking Management Project:**
- Users should be able to **search for properties** based on filters (location, price, date).  
- The system should allow users to **view detailed information** about a property (photos, amenities, reviews, price).  
- Users must be able to **create an account and log in** with secure authentication.  
- The system should enable users to **book a property** and receive a confirmation email.  
- Property owners should be able to **list new properties** and manage their listings.

### 🏗️ Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define **how the system performs** rather than specific features. They describe the quality attributes, constraints, and system behavior.  

**Examples for the Booking Management Project:**
- **Performance:** Search results should load in less than 2 seconds.  
- **Scalability:** The system must support at least 10,000 concurrent users without crashing.  
- **Usability:** The interface should be responsive and accessible on mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
- **Reliability:** The booking confirmation process should have 99.9% uptime availability.  
- **Security:** All user data must be encrypted, and sensitive data (like passwords) stored securely.  
- **Compliance:** The system must comply with GDPR for handling user information.  

## 🎭 Use Case Diagrams

### 📌 What are Use Case Diagrams?
A **Use Case Diagram** is a visual representation of the interactions between **actors** (users or external systems) and the system itself.  
It shows the **functionalities (use cases)** that the system provides and who can perform them.  

### 🌟 Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
- Provides a **clear and simple overview** of system functionality.  
- Helps **identify requirements** from a user’s perspective.  
- Improves communication between stakeholders, developers, and testers.  
- Serves as a foundation for writing detailed use cases and scenarios.  

### 🖼️ Booking System Use Case Diagram
Actors and Use Cases:
- **Actors:** User, Property Owner, System (Payment Gateway, Email Service)  
- **Use Cases:** Search property, View property details, Book property, Manage listings, Receive booking confirmation  

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### 📌 What is Acceptance Criteria?
**Acceptance Criteria** are the predefined conditions that a software feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders, testers, and end-users.  
They act as a checklist to confirm that the system behaves as expected and fulfills the requirements.  

### 🌟 Importance of Acceptance Criteria
- **Clarity:** Provides a clear definition of when a feature is "done" and ready for release.  
- **Alignment:** Ensures developers, testers, and stakeholders have the same understanding of feature expectations.  
- **Quality Assurance:** Helps testers design test cases that validate functionality.  
- **Reduces Miscommunication:** Prevents misunderstandings about scope and functionality.  
- **User Satisfaction:** Ensures the final product matches user needs and business goals.

### 🛒 Example: Checkout Feature in Booking Management System
**Feature:** Checkout process for booking a property  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
1. The system should display a **summary of the booking** (property name, price, dates).  
2. The user must be able to **enter payment details securely**.  
3. The system must validate payment information before submission.  
4. Upon successful payment, a **confirmation message** should be displayed.  
5. The system should send a **booking confirmation email** to the user.  
6. If payment fails, the user should see an **error message** with retry option.
