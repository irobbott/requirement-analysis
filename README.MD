# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## ðŸ“– Introduction
This repository is dedicated to exploring the concept of **Requirement Analysis** in software development.  

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. The goal is to clearly define what the system should do before actual development begins.  

Through this repository, we will document the key processes, techniques, and deliverables involved in requirement analysis.
